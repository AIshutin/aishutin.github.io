## Lucky chance to start

Since 2014 I was studying in "Intellectual" school, where I first met my coach [Elena Andreeva](https://istina.msu.ru/workers/1432097/). She is the trainer and manager of Russian and Moscow teams in competitive programming. I was one of her students in "Intellectual" where she was also teaching. She inspired me to study deeply algorithms&data structures and facilitates me by both mentorship and invitations to the state training camps. Her help is invaluable to me. It's a mere luck to know here.
